The GOGOGO project is the result of a data sprint that was held from 12 - 26 November 2016 in Amsterdam. The aim was to log customer journeys of people on the Knowledge Mile: the area that runs from the Nieuwmarkt to the Amstel train station. The data sprint was organized by the [Citizen Data Lab](http://www.citizendatalab.org/), in collaboration with the Media Information and Communication programme of the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, Calibro, and [Dutch Railways (NS)](http://www.ns.nl/en). 300+ students participated to collect over 206 routes, more than 94,000 unique data entries and over 98 hours of logged route data.
