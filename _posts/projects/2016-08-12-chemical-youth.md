The everyday lives of contemporary youth are awash with chemicals to boost pleasure, moods, sexual performance, appearance and health. What do pills, drinks, sprays, powders and lotions do for youth? What effects are they seeking? How can we understand the ways chemicals affect bodies and minds? These are the research questions that drove the Chemical Youth research team. For them we have design and developed a highly interactive website to present the methods used and insights produced during their innovative, tentacular anthropological project.
