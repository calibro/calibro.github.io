"Éischte Weltkrich: Remembering the Great War in Luxembourg" is a project we designed and developed for the C2DH, the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History at the University of Luxembourg, with the aim of addressing an important but neglected and understudied period in the country’s history.
The website is designed to engage a broad base of users with varying interests and degrees of expertise. It offers four independent but interconnected modes of navigation: a thematic, story-driven mode; a digital archive; an interactive geo-referenced map and a timeline.
