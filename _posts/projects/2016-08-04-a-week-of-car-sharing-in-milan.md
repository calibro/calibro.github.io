In the last few years, many cities around the world have been making big changes in terms of mobility. The rise and growth of many carsharing services has been an important factor in changing the way people move inside the city. Visualizing and analyzing data from carsharing services and other forms of urban mobility allows for a better understanding of how the city is used and helps to discover the most prominent mobility patterns.
During our work at Density Design, we created a website to visualize these patterns by exploring the data collected over the span of one week from one of the main carsharing services in Milan called [Enjoy](https://enjoy.eni.com/en).
