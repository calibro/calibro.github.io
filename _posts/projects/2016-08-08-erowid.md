The user-based online organization [Erowid](https://www.erowid.org/) aims to provide unbiased information about a broad variety of psychoactive substances. Their website provides pharmacological, chemical, biomedical and botanical resources, and hosts more than 20.000 experience reports written by drug users. In order to understand the knowledge practices associated with Erowid, and their entanglements with contemporary drug use, the Chemical Youth team explored novel methods to analyze Erowid's digital content and connect it with ethnographic expertise. The results presented provide both a glimpse into practices of reporting drug use, actual patterns of drug consumption, and the possibilities of a digitally literate anthropology.
