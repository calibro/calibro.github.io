An important aspect of our work is the strong integration between research activities, commercial projects and teaching. Together with our research partners at [DensityDesign](http://www.densitydesign.org/teaching/) and [Science Po](http://www.medialab.sciences-po.fr),  weâ€™ve had the possibility to teach and assist in different courses and workshops. During these courses we focus mainly on the interaction between the digital realm, data visualization and humanities, developing new conceptual tools and methodologies. In the last few years we have taught at [Politecnico di Milano](http://www.design.polimi.it/?lang=en), [ENSCI Les Ateliers](http://www.ensci.com/en/), [Universidade de Aveiro](http://www.ua.pt/), [Digital Methods Initiative](https://wiki.digitalmethods.net/Dmi/DmiAbout) and [Beirut Design Week](http://beirutdesignweek.org/page/57/item/732/Highlights-2012/Infographics:-Data-Visualization-Workshop), just to name a few.

Most of our teaching activities have been done in collaboration with [Donato Ricci](http://www.medialab.sciences-po.fr/people/donato-ricci/) and [DensityDesign](http://www.densitydesign.org/).
