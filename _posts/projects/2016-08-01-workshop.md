An important aspect of our work is the strong integration between research activities, commercial projects and teaching. In the last 10 years we have been involved in many teaching activities in different contexts and in different formats: universities, schools and private institutions. Our teaching activities focus is on looking at data and interfaces as a cultural and political object. Students are invited to experiment different methods and practices to approach and explore the relationship between interfaces, data and algorithms.
