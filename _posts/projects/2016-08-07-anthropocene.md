The [Anthropocene Observatory](http://territorialagency.com/projects/anthropocene-observatory/), a project by [Armin Linke](http://www.arminlinke.com), [Territorial Agency](http://territorialagency.com/) and Anselm Franke, collects and documents practices and discourses about the formation of the Anthropocene thesis and reveal the behind-the-scenes of these processes.
At the GLOBALE: Exo-Evolution exhibition at [ZKM](http://zkm.de/), we designed an interactive installation to allow the visitors to explore the themes and interviews collected by the Anthropocene Observatory. The visitors could interact with a visualization projected on a table and with the use of a tablet could explore the connections between the different topics and finally create their own customized video playlists.
