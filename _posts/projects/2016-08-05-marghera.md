The exhibition curated by Stefano Recalcati for the [15th International Architecture Biennale of Venezia](http://www.labiennale.org/it/architettura/mostra/progetti-speciali/waterfronts.html), is imagined as a voyage through time which starts with the analysis and reinterpretation of some of the most significant urban regeneration projects for industrial ports which have already been implemented or are currently being implemented, encouraging wide-ranging reflection on the principles and methods with which to approach and orient the complex conversion of production in Porto Marghera.
