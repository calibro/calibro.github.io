RAWGraphs is an open web tool developed at the DensityDesign Research Lab (Politecnico di Milano) to create custom vector-based visualizations on top of the amazing [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) library by Mike Bostock. Primarily conceived as a tool for designers and vis geeks, RAW aims at providing a missing link between spreadsheet applications and vector graphics editors.
Based on the svg format, visualizations can be easily edited with vector graphics applications for further refinements, or directly embedded into web pages. The project has been rewarded in 2014 at the [Kantar Information is Beautiful Awards](http://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/news/49-2014-the-winners) as best tool and project of the year.
