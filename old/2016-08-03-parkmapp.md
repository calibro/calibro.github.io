PARK Mapp is a guide to modern and contemporary architecture in Milan, curated by [Park Associati](http://www.parkassociati.com/EN/News.aspx), an Architecture and Design Studio based in Milan.
The app explores a selection of iconic pieces of architecture allowing the user to discover unexpected places around Milan. Besides architecture and design, there are also suggestions on the most exciting locations for food, drinks, shops, cultural spaces and insiders' tips, offered in the ‘lifestyle’ section of the app personally curated by PARK Associati employees and friends.
